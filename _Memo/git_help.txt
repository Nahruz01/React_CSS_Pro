1️⃣ Repository setup
Command	What it does
git init	Initializes a new Git repository in the current folder. Creates a .git folder to track history.
git clone <repo_url>	Makes a local copy of a remote repository. Equivalent to downloading it.

Command	What it does
git add <file>	Adds a specific file to the staging area (preparing it to commit).
git add .	Adds all changed files in the folder to staging.
git commit -m "message"	Creates a commit with all staged changes and a message describing the change.
git status	Shows current branch, staged files, unstaged changes, and untracked files.
git diff	Shows line-by-line differences between your working files and last commit.
git log	Shows the commit history of the current branch.
3️⃣ Working with branches
Command	What it does
git branch	Lists local branches. Current branch marked with *.
git branch -r	Lists remote branches.
git branch -a	Lists all branches (local + remote).
git branch <branch_name>	Creates a new branch locally.
git checkout <branch_name>	Switches to an existing branch.
git switch <branch_name>	Modern alternative to checkout for switching branches.
git checkout -b <branch_name>	Creates a new branch and switches to it immediately.
git merge <branch_name>	Merges the specified branch into the current branch.
git branch -d <branch_name>	Deletes a local branch (only if merged).
git branch -D <branch_name>	Force deletes a branch, even if unmerged.
